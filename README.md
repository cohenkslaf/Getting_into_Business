# Real Estate Investment Data Exploration by Kasey Cohen

## Overview
In this project, I analyze U.S. real estate data from 2000 to 2023 to uncover key trends, insights, and investment opportunities. The analysis explores various attributes of properties, such as price, size, location, and age, and evaluates their impact on house prices. Through statistical analysis and visualizations, this project aims to provide a solid understanding of the U.S. housing market and its investment potential.
