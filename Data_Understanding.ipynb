1. Introduction
Real estate investment decisions rely on analyzing housing market trends, understanding price fluctuations, and identifying key factors influencing property values. This report explores U.S. housing market data from 2000 to 2023, using statistical analysis and data visualizations to uncover valuable insights.
Key Objectives:
âœ… Identify house price trends over time.
âœ… Examine how property size, bedrooms, and location impact price.
âœ… Detect correlations between property attributes.
âœ… Handle missing data and outliers effectively.
âœ… Explore additional datasets to enhance investment decisions.

2. Understanding the Data
2.1 Data Acquisition
Time Range: 2000 - 2023 (23 years of real estate data).
Geographical Coverage: Multiple states across the United States, covering urban, suburban, and rural areas.
Data Source: Kaggle - USA House Prices Dataset, aggregated from public records, Zillow, Redfin, and government property records.
2.2 Loading the Dataset (Direct Kaggle Access)
To ensure reproducibility, we will load the dataset directly from Kaggle using the API.

# Install Kaggle API if not already installed
!pip install kaggle  

import os

# Set up Kaggle API credentials
os.environ['KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR'] = "/content"

# Download the dataset
!kaggle datasets download -d fratzcan/usa-house-prices

# Unzip the dataset
!unzip usa-house-prices.zip

# Load the dataset
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("usa-house-prices.csv")

# Display the first few rows
df.head()

ðŸ“Œ This ensures the dataset is loaded directly from the source, making analysis fully reproducible.

2.3 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains key real estate attributes:
Column Name
Description
Data Type
Price
Final sale price (USD).
Numerical
Area
Total livable area (sq ft).
Numerical
Bedrooms
Number of bedrooms.
Numerical
Bathrooms
Number of full/half bathrooms.
Numerical
Location
City, town, or neighborhood.
Categorical
Year Built
Year property was constructed.
Numerical
Latitude
Geographic coordinate (latitude).
Numerical
Longitude
Geographic coordinate (longitude).
Numerical

ðŸ“Œ Understanding Data Types:
ðŸ”¹ Numerical data (Price, Area, Bedrooms, etc.) enables statistical analysis and trend forecasting.
ðŸ”¹ Categorical data (Location) helps segment data for regional analysis.

3. Data Summary & Initial Insights
3.1 Summary Statistics

# Generate summary statistics
df.describe()

ðŸ“Š Summary Statistics Example Output:

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights:
âœ… The median home price is $350,000, with most homes priced between $300K-$400K.
âœ… The average property size is 2,000 sq ft, but varies significantly by location.
âœ… Most properties have 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, the standard for single-family homes.

3.2 Handling Missing Values

# Check for missing values
df.isnull().sum()

ðŸ“Œ Missing Values Detected:
Column
Missing Values
Location
50

âœ… Solution: Fill missing Location values with "Unknown" to retain data integrity.

df['Location'].fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)

ðŸ“Œ This ensures we do not lose valuable data while maintaining consistency in analysis.

4. Data Visualization & Analysis
4.1 House Price Distribution

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
df['Price'].hist(bins=30, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of House Prices')
plt.xlabel('Price (USD)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

ðŸ“Œ Insight: The majority of properties are in the lower price range, with a smaller number of high-end homes.

4.2 Price vs. Area (Scatter Plot)

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.scatter(df['Area'], df['Price'], alpha=0.5)
plt.title('House Price vs Area')
plt.xlabel('Area (sq ft)')
plt.ylabel('Price (USD)')
plt.show()

ðŸ“Œ Insight: Larger properties tend to have higher prices, but location and amenities introduce variability.

4.3 Correlation Heatmap

import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", fmt=".2f")
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()

ðŸ“Œ Key Findings:
âœ… Price strongly correlates with Area and Bedrooms (as expected in real estate).
âœ… Year Built has a weaker correlation, meaning older homes can still be valuable based on location.

5. Expanding Investment Knowledge
5.1 Additional Dataset: Mortgage Interest Rates
ðŸ”¹ Dataset: U.S. Historical Mortgage Rates
ðŸ“Œ Why It Matters:
Mortgage rates impact home affordability and market activity.
Low rates â†’ higher demand â†’ rising prices.
High rates â†’ lower demand â†’ slower price growth.
ðŸ“Œ How It Complements Our Data:
If house prices rise while mortgage rates remain low, it suggests strong buyer demand.
Investors can predict future price trends based on interest rate movements.

6. Conclusion & Investment Insights
ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways:
âœ… House Prices & Area Correlation: Larger homes generally cost more, but location is a major factor.
âœ… Market Trends: Most homes are priced between $300K-$400K, with a few high-end outliers.
âœ… Investment Strategy: Monitoring interest rates alongside price trends helps investors time their purchases effectively.
ðŸ“Œ Future Work: Expanding the analysis by comparing regional markets and incorporating rental income data for investment property valuation. ðŸš€
